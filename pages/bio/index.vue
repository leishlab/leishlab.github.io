My ultimate research goal is to define therapeutic targets for leishmaniasis treatment.</p>

            <p>I received my undergraduate degree in Molecular Sciences and a Ph.D. from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. During my PhD, Dr. Lucile Maria Floeter-Winter was my advisor, and I also worked in an interniship at Steve Beverley’s laboratory at Washington University of St Louis (USA).</p>
            <p>As a graduate student, I elucidated the role of <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> arginase that defines the fate of L-arginine and showed that correct subcellular localization of arginase is essential for enzyme activity and optimal parasite infectivity.</p>
            <p>As a postdoctoral fellow at USP, working with Dr. Regina P. Markus and Prof. Lucile Maria Floeter-Winter, I discovered that the hormone melatonin attenuates <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> burden in an animal model. </p>
            <p>My interests in iron and heme metabolism were sparked when I joined Dr. Norma Andrews’ lab at the University of Maryland as a Post-Doctoral Fellow, and then Dr. Iqbal Hamza’s lab as a Research Associate. In the Andrews’ lab, I identified and characterized the first iron exporter (LIR1) in a trypanosomatid parasite and showed that iron export is essential for <span class="italic">Leishmania</span> iron homeostasis and infectivity thereby answering an important question about how these parasites prevent accumulation of free iron to avoid cytotoxicity. In the Hamza lab, I gained a deeper understanding for host iron and heme metabolism pathways by studying the function of mouse and human HRG1.</p>
            <p>I started my independent career as an early-stage investigator in Brazil when I was competitively awarded a Young Investigator FAPESP grant.</p>
